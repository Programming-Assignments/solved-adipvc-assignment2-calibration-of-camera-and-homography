Given   an  image  you  are       asked   to         estimate          the       projection        matrices          of a          camera            (in        the       imaging           system).           For       estimating       the       projection matrix develop           an        interactive       interface,        which   can      perform           the       following operations       on        an        image.

<ul>

 <li>Compute the       pixel    coordinate       of         a          point    in         an</li>

 <li>Compute the       length  in         pixels   between          two      image</li>

 <li>Compute the       vanishing         point    of         two      parallel            lines     (in        real      world)  as       identified         by        the</li>

 <li>Prepare a          data     file       with     saved   correspondences         of         image  pixel    coordinates       and      real      world</li>

</ul>




Using   the       above  tool      and      also      other   associated       functions         as         you      need,   form the       projection        matrices          (they    are       different!)       of         the       following         two images with     the                   information     related to         the       world   coordinates     specified          with it.




<ol>

 <li>Name of         the       image:”Helipad.jpg”</li>

</ol>

Information     of         world   coordinates:    Consider          the       height  of         the       vertical pillars  is          of         2          meters,            separated        by        a          distance           of         4 meters,            and      width   of         the       road     including         thickness         of         both     the white   borders            is          1.5       meters.

 <li>Name of         the       image: “Palace.jpg”</li>

</ol>

Assume            it          is          a          case     of         affine   projection,       implying images of         parallel            lines     are       also      parallel            in         the       image.

Information     of         world   coordinates:                Use      a          plausible          world coordinate       system by        assuming         the       walls    parallel            of         XZ        and      YZplanes.
